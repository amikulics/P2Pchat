# P2Pchat
 
Typical chat applications like iMessage or Facebook messenger use a client server structure wheer each person acts as a client that communicates with a central server. We wanted to make a chat application that could allow two users to communicate directly. This program also uses the tkinter library for GUI and was originally written for our Networking class.
